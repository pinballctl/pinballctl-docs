Default login credentials:

- Username: `admin`
- Password: `password`

Change the default password after your first login via `System -> Settings`.

## Dashboard Overview

After login, you land on the Dashboard. This is your at-a-glance machine status page.

The dashboard cards show key status areas such as Wi-Fi, bridge state, ESP32 connectivity, dependencies, uptime, and gameplay or machine metrics.

Use this page first when checking whether your system is healthy.

## Control Centre

Use the grid icon in the top bar to open the Control Centre. This is the main navigation hub for all areas.

The Control Centre groups pages by purpose:

- Overview: high-level operational pages.
- Authoring: Rules, Lighting, and playfield-related work.
- Platform: hardware, firmware, and ESPLink.
- Operations: logs and service diagnostics.
- System: settings such as Wi-Fi and install-wide options.

## Search

Use the search box (top right of Control Centre) to filter the available pages.

Search is best when you type the page name directly, for example: `lighting`, `rules`, `hardware`, or `manual`, then click the page you want.

## Recently Visited

Pinball CTL keeps quick shortcuts so you can get back to pages you use most.

The Recently Visited row gives one-click access to pages you opened recently.

## Bookmarks

When you hover over a link, a yellow bookmark icon appears.

Clicking the icon adds that link to the top bookmarks menu for faster access to frequently used areas.

You can also drag and drop items in the top bookmarks menu to arrange them in your preferred order.
