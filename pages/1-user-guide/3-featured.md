## Dashboard

The Dashboard is the first operational view after login. It is designed for quick checks before you start rule or lighting work.

Key features:

- Live status cards for network, bridge, ESP32 link, and uptime.
- Dependency visibility for required tooling.
- High-level machine and gameplay metrics in one place.
- Fast way to spot faults before troubleshooting deeper features.

## Manual

The Manual keeps user and technical documentation inside Pinball CTL, so setup and diagnostics guides are always close to the system.

Key features:

- Left-hand document tree with folders and pages.
- Built-in search for finding topics quickly.
- Bookmark support for frequently used pages.
- Light and dark mode aware styling.

## Rules

Rules is the gameplay authoring area. It defines how machine events trigger actions and behaviour.

Key features:

- Rule creation and editing workflows.
- Trigger and condition-based action execution.
- Integration with lighting actions (including scene selection and control options).
- Structured configuration storage for repeatable deployments.

## Scoring

Scoring is the point-system authoring area. It lets you build base points, progressive hit rules, and combo awards without writing code.

Key features:

- Base points table for fixed score awards from hardware and fired events.
- Progressive scoring rules with minimum hit thresholds and optional time windows.
- Cooloff controls to reduce hit streak value over time.
- Combo authoring with ordered or any-order step matching.
- Optional combo multipliers and emitted events for integration with Rules and Lighting.

## Audio

Audio manages sound assets and runtime playback rules from one place on the Pi side.

Key features:

- Asset library with multi-upload and inline preview.
- Cue editor for output, bus, volume, loop, repeats, and cooldown.
- Output/device visibility and runtime playback monitoring.
- Usage mapping for quick cue/asset lookup and diagnostics.

## Media

Media is the scene authoring and playback module for videos and overlays across your configured displays.

Key features:

- Stage editor with scene selector, options, overlays, and live preview.
- Launch controls for fullscreen kiosk and small-window testing.
- Library tab for asset upload, browsing, and preview.
- Displays tab for detection and runtime environment checks.
- Runtime tab for active scene visibility and stop controls.

## Lighting

Lighting is a full scene authoring workflow for table effects and player feedback.

Key features:

- Scene and timeline editing.
- Pattern-based animation generation.
- Custom keyframes and tag-based frame markers.
- Cast targeting, layering options, and playback controls.
- Build your lighting plan by scene, timeline, and target selection.
- Apply pattern/show behaviour and test playback in preview before rollout.
- Tune behaviour safely without requiring immediate live hardware control.

## Playfield

Playfield is the visual model of your playfield and hardware placement.

Key features:

- Placement and sizing of playfield elements.
- Simulation preview for quick visual validation as you build.
- Hardware binding support for visual validation.
- Editing tools to maintain a clean machine map.
- Preview the playfield changes before applying them to your live machine workflow.
- Playfield event handling mirrors hardware flow, so triggers and responses behave consistently.
- Test trigger logic with immediate on-screen feedback that reflects hardware events.
- Useful reference context when authoring rules and lighting.

## Hardware

Hardware manages the machine's physical I/O mapping and integration data used by runtime services.

Key features:

- Mapping of switches, coils, lights, and related channels.
- Hardware profile and mapping management.
- Data used by bridge/runtime deployment steps.
- Foundation for safe, deterministic control at runtime.

## ESPLink

ESPLink manages the Pi-to-ESP workflow and device-side compatibility checks.

Key features:

- Connection and sync status visibility.
- Clear checks that Pi and ESP are on matching versions and manifest data before deployment.
- Workflow support for updating or synchronising device state.
- Integration point between authoring on Pi and execution on ESP32.

## Firmware

Firmware supports firmware package handling and update flow for ESP targets.

Key features:

- Firmware metadata and package handling.
- Updates from official Pinball CTL releases are available and listed here.
- Assisted update/deploy workflow hooks.
- Clear separation between host-side authoring and device runtime code.
- Useful for controlled release and maintenance tasks.

## Service Log

Service Log focuses on service and maintenance history for managed services.

Key features:

- Service and maintenance logging for users and engineers.
- Maintenance history for physical machine work such as cleaning and inspections.
- Records of hardware replacement and service actions over time.
- Helps teams track what was serviced, when it was done, and what changed.
- Helps confirm long-running service stability.

## Logs

Logs provides direct access to application and bridge output for troubleshooting.

Key features:

- Read runtime logs from the web UI.
- Inspect bridge and web logging without leaving the browser.
- Useful for identifying serial, protocol, or configuration issues.
- Supports day-to-day diagnostics during development and testing.

## Wi-Fi

Wi-Fi shows and manages network connection details relevant to remote use.

Key features:

- Current connection status and interface details.
- Wi-Fi setup/update controls.
- Helps confirm browser access and API reachability.
- Core tool for headless Pi deployments.
- Planned: Wi-Fi connected services will provide support for global leaderboards.

## Settings

Settings contains installation-wide configuration options.

Key features:

- Identity and general system settings.
- Security-related settings such as login credentials.
- Import/export style configuration workflows where supported.
- Central place for persistent environment-level options.
