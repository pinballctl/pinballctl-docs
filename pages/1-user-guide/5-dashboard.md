# Dashboard

The Dashboard is your live status overview for Pinball CTL.

<img src="./media/screenshot-dashboard.png" data-source='{"url":"/login","next_url":"/dashboard","dark_mode":true,"settle_ms":320,"click":[{"action":"type","selector":"input[name=\"username\"]"},{"action":"type","selector":"input[name=\"password\"]"},{"action":"click","selector":"button[type=\"submit\"]","wait_for":"[data-menu-toggle]"}]}' alt="Dashboard feature overview" style="width: 100%; max-width: 800px; height: auto;">

The Dashboard is designed as a fast health check page before you edit rules, lighting, hardware, or firmware.

## What This Feature Does

It continuously polls runtime APIs and presents a single at-a-glance state for:

- connectivity
- bridge/runtime processes
- ESP state
- sync status
- dependency/tooling readiness

## Live Refresh Behaviour

Dashboard refreshes automatically in the background.

Key behaviour:

- Regular polling (about every 10 seconds).
- Polling pauses when the page is hidden, then resumes when visible.
- If bridge is running but ESP is not yet connected, quick retry mode is used.

## Typical Workflow

1. Open Dashboard first.
2. Confirm Wi-Fi, Bridge, and ESP are healthy.
3. Check sync status rows when ESP is connected.
4. If not healthy, move to the relevant feature:
   - Logs for runtime output
   - Hardware for mapping/sync
   - ESPLink for bridge/device controls

## Example Checks

### Pre-deployment check

Before syncing rules or lighting:

- Bridge = Running
- ESP Connected = Yes
- Time Sync = OK
- Dependencies = all `OK`

### Post-maintenance check

After service work:

- Wi-Fi badge = Yes
- Bridge PID populated
- Uptime progressing normally
- no unexpected sync regressions
