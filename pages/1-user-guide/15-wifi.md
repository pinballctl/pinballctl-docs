## What This Feature Does

It shows live network state and lets you update SSID/password from the web interface.

## Current Status Card

Displays:

- SSID
- IP
- State
- Connected badge (`Yes`/`No`)

Status refreshes regularly (about every 5 seconds).

## Update Settings Form

## Save Behaviour

Saves are submitted to Wi-Fi API and status refresh is triggered after successful update.

Use this for first setup changes or network migration.

## Planned Capability

Planned: Wi-Fi connected services will provide support for global leaderboards.

## Practical Examples
